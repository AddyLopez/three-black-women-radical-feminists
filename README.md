## Project Description & Background

This simple responsive website is an example of what I can spontaneously build from scratch in an afternoon. I researched and curated the content independently that same day to present to my political study group. I loathe making PowerPoints, so I coded a website for fun instead (to share my notes).

It ended up being a good idea and pedagogical tool for a number of reasons. First, I didn't have to waste the group's time setting up a projector. Second, everyone was able to comfortably follow along to my presentation on their phone or laptop (their choice), which made my communication more effective and facilitated the learning. Further, giving team members the link to the website meant that they were empowered to explore my sources or replay any media I shared at their future convenience, thereby eliminating the need for them to fully digest the information on the spot. Finally, the website counteracts the ephemerality of the presentation and extends the value of my research beyond the team and that limited setting to anyone interested who has the link.

As a developer, I like to experiment and find creative opportunities to expand the social and personal uses of web development, so I feel that the extra effort was well worth it!

## Content Description

This website seeks to bridge Black History Month and International Women's Day by spotlighting the contributions of three Black women radical feminists: Kimberl√© Crenshaw, Pat Parker, and June Jordan. Its purpose is to edify and inspire through these women's poetry, other writings, or example.

"Radical" in this context is not meant as an epithet of reproach, as it's often used by right-wing or centrist ideologues, or as an informal synonym for a practice or attitude that is vaguely "extreme." Radical politics recuperates the word's origins in the Latin 'radix,' which means 'the root,' and therefore seeks the source of, and solution to, societal ills and problems 'at the root' and not on the superficial or symptomatic level that merely reformist politics does.
