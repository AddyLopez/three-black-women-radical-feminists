      This document seeks to bridge Black History Month and International
      Women&#39;s Day by exploring the contributions of three Black women
      radical feminists: Kimberlé Crenshaw, Pat Parker, and June Jordan.

    <p>
      &quot;Kimberlé W. Crenshaw is a pioneering scholar and writer on civil
      rights, critical race theory, Black feminist legal theory, and race,
      racism and the law. (...)
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Crenshaw’s work has been foundational in critical race theory and in
      &#39;intersectionality,&#39; a term she coined to describe the double bind
      of simultaneous racial and gender prejudice. Her studies, writing, and
      activism have identified key issues in the perpetuation of inequality,
      including the &#39;school to prison pipeline&#39; for African American
      children and the criminalization of behavior among Black teenage girls.
      Through the Columbia Law School African American Policy Forum (AAPF),
      which she co-founded, Crenshaw co-authored (with Andrea Ritchie) Say Her
      Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women, which documented and
      drew attention to the killing of Black women and girls by police. Crenshaw
      and AAPF subsequently launched the #SayHerName campaign to call attention
      to police violence against Black women and girls. (...)
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Crenshaw’s groundbreaking work on intersectionality was influential
      in the drafting of the equality clause in the South African Constitution.
      She authored the background paper on race and gender discrimination for
      the United Nations’ World Conference on Racism in 2001, served as the
      rapporteur for the conference’s expert group on gender and race
      discrimination, and coordinated NGO efforts to ensure the inclusion of
      gender in the WCAR Conference Declaration.&quot; ~

    <h3 id="concept-of-intersectionality-">Concept of Intersectionality:</h3>
    <p>
      &quot;Crenshaw is known for introducing and developing intersectional
      theory, the study of how overlapping or intersecting social identities,
      particularly minority identities, relate to systems and structures of
      oppression, domination, or discrimination. Her work further expands to
      include intersectional feminism, which is a sub-category related to
      intersectional theory. Intersectional feminism examines the overlapping
      systems of oppression and discrimination that women face due to their
      ethnicity, sexuality, and economic background. (...)
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Crenshaw characterizes intersectionality as, &#39;a lens, a prism,
      for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality often operate
      together and exacerbate each other. We tend to talk about race inequality
      as separate from inequality based on gender, class, sexuality or
      immigration status. What&#39;s often missing is how some people are
      subject to all of these, and the experience is not just a sum of its
      parts.&#39;&quot; ~

    <p>
      &quot;Pat Parker (born Patricia Cooks; January 20, 1944 – June 17, 1989)
      was an American poet and activist. Both her poetry and her activism drew
      from her experiences as an African-American lesbian feminist. Her poetry
      spoke about her tough childhood growing up in poverty, dealing with sexual
      assault, and the murder of a sister. At eighteen, Parker was in an abusive
      relationship and had a miscarriage after being pushed down a flight of
      stairs. After two divorces she came out as lesbian &#39;embracing her
      sexuality&#39; and said she was liberated and &#39;knew no limits when it
      came to expressing the innermost parts of herself&#39;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Parker participated in political activism and had early involvement
      with the Black Panther Party and Black Women&#39;s Revolutionary Council,
      and formed the Women&#39;s Press Collective. She participated in many
      forms of activism especially regarding gay and lesbian communities,
      domestic violence, and rights of people of color. She released five poetry
      collections: <em>Child of Myself</em> (1972), <em>Pit Stop</em> (1975),
      <em>Movement in Black</em> (1978), <em>Woman Slaughter</em> (1978), and
      <em>Jonestown and Other Madness</em>
      (1985).&quot; ~

    <h3 id="bio-">Bio:</h3>
    <p>
      &quot;One of the most widely-published and highly-acclaimed Jamaican
      American writers of her generation, poet, playwright and essayist June
      Jordan was known for her fierce commitment to human rights and political
      activism. Over a career that produced twenty-seven volumes of poems,
      essays, libretti, and work for children, Jordan engaged the fundamental
      struggles of her era: for civil rights, women’s rights, and sexual
      freedom. A prolific writer across genres, Jordan’s poetry is known for its
      immediacy and accessibility as well as its interest in identity and the
      representation of personal, lived experience—her poetry is often deeply
      autobiographical. Jordan’s work also frequently imagines a radical,
      globalized notion of solidarity amongst the world’s marginalized and
      oppressed. In volumes like <em>Some Changes</em> (1971),
      <em>Living Room</em> (1985) and
      <em>Kissing God Goodbye: Poems 1991-1997</em> (1997), Jordan uses
      conversational, often vernacular English to address topics ranging from
      family, bisexuality, political oppression, racial identity and racial
      inequality, and memory. Regarded as one of the key figures in the
      mid-century American social, political and artistic milieu, Jordan also
      taught at many of the country’s most prestigious universities(...)&quot; ~

    <p>Excerpt:</p>

      <li>
        <p>(pp. 46-47):</p>
        <p>
          &quot;The plane&#39;s ready for takeoff. I fasten my seatbelt and let
          the tumult inside my head run free. Yes: race and class and gender
          remain as real as the weather. But what they must mean about the
          contact between two individuals is less obvious and, like the weather,
          not predictable.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;And when these factors of race and class and gender absolutely
          collapse is whenever you try to use them as automatic concepts of
          connection. They may serve well as indicators of commonly felt
          conflict, but as elements of connection they seem about as reliable as
          precipitation probability for the day after the night before the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It occurs to me that much organizatonal grief could be avoided
          if people understood that partnership in misery does not necessarily
          provide for partnership for change:
          <em
            >When we get the monsters off our backs all of us may want to run in
            very different directions.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;And not only that: even though both &#39;Olive&#39; and
          &#39;I&#39; live inside a conflict neither one of us created, and even
          though both of us therefore hurt inside that conflict, I may be one of
          the monsters she needs to eliminate from her universe and, in a sense,
          she may be one of the monsters in mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I am reaching for the words to describe the difference between a
          common identity that has been imposed and the individual identity any
          one of us will choose, once she gains that chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;That difference is the one that keeps us stupid in the face of
          new, specific information about somebody else with whom we are
          supposed to have a connection because a third party, hostile to both
          of us, has worked it so that the two of us, like it or not, share a
          common enemy.
          <em
            >What happens beyond the idea of that enemy and beyond the
            consequences of that enemy?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I am saying that the ultimate connection cannot be the enemy.
          The ultimate connection must be the need that we find between us. It
          is not only who you are, in other words, but what we can do for each
          other that will determine the connection.&quot;
