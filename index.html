        Three Black Women Radical Feminists
      </h1>
      <p>
        This website seeks to bridge Black History Month and International
        Women&#39;s Day by spotlighting the contributions of three Black women
        radical feminists: Kimberlé Crenshaw, Pat Parker, and June Jordan. Its
        purpose is to edify and inspire through these women's poetry, other
        writings, or example.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Radical" in this context is not meant as an epithet of reproach, as
        it's often used by right-wing or centrist ideologues, or as an informal
        synonym for a practice or attitude that is vaguely "extreme." Radical
        politics recuperates the word's origins in the Latin 'radix,' which
        means 'the root,' and therefore seeks the source of, and solution to,
        societal ills and problems 'at the root' and not on the superficial or
        symptomatic level that merely reformist politics does.

            &quot;Kimberlé W. Crenshaw is a pioneering scholar and writer on
            civil rights, critical race theory, Black feminist legal theory, and
            race, racism and the law. (...)
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Crenshaw’s work has been foundational in critical race theory
            and in &#39;intersectionality,&#39; a term she coined to describe
            the double bind of simultaneous racial and gender prejudice. Her
            studies, writing, and activism have identified key issues in the
            perpetuation of inequality, including the &#39;school to prison
            pipeline&#39; for African American children and the criminalization
            of behavior among Black teenage girls. Through the Columbia Law
            School African American Policy Forum (AAPF), which she co-founded,
            Crenshaw co-authored (with Andrea Ritchie) Say Her Name: Resisting
            Police Brutality Against Black Women, which documented and drew
            attention to the killing of Black women and girls by police.
            Crenshaw and AAPF subsequently launched the #SayHerName campaign to
            call attention to police violence against Black women and girls.
            (...)
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Crenshaw’s groundbreaking work on intersectionality was
            influential in the drafting of the equality clause in the South
            African Constitution. She authored the background paper on race and
            gender discrimination for the United Nations’ World Conference on
            Racism in 2001, served as the rapporteur for the conference’s expert
            group on gender and race discrimination, and coordinated NGO efforts
            to ensure the inclusion of gender in the WCAR Conference
            Declaration.&quot; ~

            Concept of Intersectionality:
          </h3>
          <p>
            &quot;Crenshaw is known for introducing and developing
            intersectional theory, the study of how overlapping or intersecting
            social identities, particularly minority identities, relate to
            systems and structures of oppression, domination, or discrimination.
            Her work further expands to include intersectional feminism, which
            is a sub-category related to intersectional theory. Intersectional
            feminism examines the overlapping systems of oppression and
            discrimination that women face due to their ethnicity, sexuality,
            and economic background. (...)
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Crenshaw characterizes intersectionality as, &#39;a lens, a
            prism, for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality often
            operate together and exacerbate each other. We tend to talk about
            race inequality as separate from inequality based on gender, class,
            sexuality or immigration status. What&#39;s often missing is how
            some people are subject to all of these, and the experience is not
            just a sum of its parts.&#39;&quot; ~

            &quot;Pat Parker (born Patricia Cooks; January 20, 1944 – June 17,
            1989) was an American poet and activist. Both her poetry and her
            activism drew from her experiences as an African-American lesbian
            feminist. Her poetry spoke about her tough childhood growing up in
            poverty, dealing with sexual assault, and the murder of a sister. At
            eighteen, Parker was in an abusive relationship and had a
            miscarriage after being pushed down a flight of stairs. After two
            divorces she came out as lesbian &#39;embracing her sexuality&#39;
            and said she was liberated and &#39;knew no limits when it came to
            expressing the innermost parts of herself&#39;.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Parker participated in political activism and had early
            involvement with the Black Panther Party and Black Women&#39;s
            Revolutionary Council, and formed the Women&#39;s Press Collective.
            She participated in many forms of activism especially regarding gay
            and lesbian communities, domestic violence, and rights of people of
            color. She released five poetry collections:
            <span>Child of Myself</span> (1972), <span>Pit Stop</span> (1975),
            <span>Movement in Black</span> (1978),
            <span>Woman Slaughter</span> (1978), and
            <span>Jonestown and Other Madness</span>
            (1985).&quot; ~

            &quot;One of the most widely-published and highly-acclaimed Jamaican
            American writers of her generation, poet, playwright and essayist
            June Jordan was known for her fierce commitment to human rights and
            political activism. Over a career that produced twenty-seven volumes
            of poems, essays, libretti, and work for children, Jordan engaged
            the fundamental struggles of her era: for civil rights, women’s
            rights, and sexual freedom. A prolific writer across genres,
            Jordan’s poetry is known for its immediacy and accessibility as well
            as its interest in identity and the representation of personal,
            lived experience—her poetry is often deeply autobiographical.
            Jordan’s work also frequently imagines a radical, globalized notion
            of solidarity amongst the world’s marginalized and oppressed. In
            volumes like
            <span>Some Changes</span> (1971), <span>Living Room</span> (1985)
            and <span>Kissing God Goodbye: Poems 1991-1997</span> (1997), Jordan
            uses conversational, often vernacular English to address topics
            ranging from family, bisexuality, political oppression, racial
            identity and racial inequality, and memory. Regarded as one of the
            key figures in the mid-century American social, political and
            artistic milieu, Jordan also taught at many of the country’s most
            prestigious universities(...)&quot; ~

              <p>(pp. 46-47, original emphasis in italics):</p>
              <p>
                &quot;The plane&#39;s ready for takeoff. I fasten my seatbelt
                and let the tumult inside my head run free. Yes: race and class
                and gender remain as real as the weather. But what they must
                mean about the contact between two individuals is less obvious
                and, like the weather, not predictable.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;And when these factors of race and class and gender
                absolutely collapse is whenever you try to use them as automatic
                concepts of connection. They may serve well as indicators of
                commonly felt conflict, but as elements of connection they seem
                about as reliable as precipitation probability for the day after
                the night before the day.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;It occurs to me that much organizatonal grief could be
                avoided if people understood that partnership in misery does not
                necessarily provide for partnership for change:
                <em
                  >When we get the monsters off our backs all of us may want to
                  run in very different directions.</em
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;And not only that: even though both &#39;Olive&#39; and
                &#39;I&#39; live inside a conflict neither one of us created,
                and even though both of us therefore hurt inside that conflict,
                I may be one of the monsters she needs to eliminate from her
                universe and, in a sense, she may be one of the monsters in
                mine.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I am reaching for the words to describe the difference
                between a common identity that has been imposed and the
                individual identity any one of us will choose, once she gains
                that chance.
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;That difference is the one that keeps us stupid in the
                face of new, specific information about somebody else with whom
                we are supposed to have a connection because a third party,
                hostile to both of us, has worked it so that the two of us, like
                it or not, share a common enemy.
                <em
                  >What happens beyond the idea of that enemy and beyond the
                  consequences of that enemy?</em
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;I am saying that the ultimate connection cannot be the
                enemy. The ultimate connection must be the need that we find
                between us. It is not only who you are, in other words, but what
                we can do for each other that will determine the
                connection.&quot;
